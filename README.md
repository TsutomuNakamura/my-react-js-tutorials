# my-react-js-tutorials
This is my training repository featured the lesson of [React JS Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABj2GQSlDRjgvXtqfDxKm5b).
Source codes in this repository are based on [learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials](https://github.com/learncodeacademy/react-js-tutorials) and they were rewritten in order to suit with modern packages such as React, webpack and  react-router etc.
